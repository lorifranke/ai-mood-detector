## Overview
This repository provides a beginner-friendly tutorial on building a simple AI model to detect the mood (positive, negative, or neutral) from text input. We'll use Python and scikit-learn to train a logistic regression model on a synthetic dataset. This is a great starting point for learning machine learning basics like data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

No advanced knowledge required‚Äîjust Python basics! The project uses open-source libraries.

### Why This Project?
- **Educational**: Step-by-step guide to ML workflow.
- **Practical**: Detect moods in reviews, tweets, or chat messages.
- **Extendable**: Add more features like real datasets or deep learning.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 1: Set Up Environment
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-mood-detector.git`
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd ai-mood-detector-tutorial`
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2: Understanding the Data
We'll use a small synthetic CSV dataset (`training_data.csv`) with two columns:
- `text`: Sample sentences.
- `mood`: Labels (0 = negative, 1 = neutral, 2 = positive).

Example rows:
text,mood
"I hate this weather",0
"The movie was okay",1
"I love this project!",2

This dataset is tiny for test purposes‚Äî in real projects, use larger ones like from Kaggle (check licenses).

## Step 3: Dataset
The dataset is in `training_data.csv`.

## Step 4: Code
Code is in `mood_detector.py`.

## Step 5: Extending the Project

Add More Data: Replace training_data.csv with a real dataset (e.g., IMDb reviews, other scraped datasets, reviews etc.).
Improve Model: Try SVM or neural networks with TensorFlow.
Deploy: Turn it into a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
Visualize: Add plots with Matplotlib to show confusion matrices.
